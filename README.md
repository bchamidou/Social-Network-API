## Description
***

The challenge is to build an API for a social network application. The users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. technology used are Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. We may also optionally use a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.
